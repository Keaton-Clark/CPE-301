Questions
1. A pin on the Arduino is a semi-arbitrary number assigned to a pin on the
microcontroller present on the specific model of Arduino. This helps us to
more easily interface with the microcontroller through the Arduino IDE.
2. The serial port is in reference to the UART communication you are able
to use on the ATMEGA2560 which is a type of serial communication that
works with two lines to transmit and receive at the same time. On the
Arduino Mega 2560 this is actually communicating with a second microcontroller (ATMEGA16u2) which then handles communication through
USB.
3. Analog data is transmitted by a variable voltage, on the Arduino it is
0-5v, and can be expressed as a range of values correlating to the ratio of
the signal voltage to the maximum readable voltages. Digital on the other
hand is simply the presence or absence of a signal with 0v correlating to
a 0 and any percievable voltage correlating to a 1.

Oscilloscope
1. The Oscilloscope reads ≈ 0V when the button is not pressed.

2. The Oscilloscope reads ≈ 4.6V − 5V when pressed.

3. This is due to us writing to the DDR and PORT register telling the IC to
allow power to travel through that pin.
